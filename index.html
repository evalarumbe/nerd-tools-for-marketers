        <h3>An overview on caching and cookies</h3>
        <p>Every browser you have installed sets aside some temporary storage on your computer for caching and cookies. (It's common for web developers to install many different browsers to help test for inconsistencies). The main job of private / incognito windows is to ignore temporary storage and let you browse as if you had no existing cache or cookies.</p>

        <h4>Cache</h4>
        <p>A cache is a place to temporarily store files so they're faster to retrieve. We do this all the time: if you're getting ready to make dinner tonight, you might set out some ingredients on the kitchen counter just temporarily so they're faster to reach, even though their rightful home is inside the cupboard.</p>

        <p>Computers typically use many different kinds of caches, at hardware and software level. In web development, we are usually talking about <em>the browser cache</em>.</p>

        <p>The cache is useful for storing heavy files like images, on websites you visit frequently. This lets pages load faster without making you repeatedly download the same image.</p>

        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>A cookie is a file stored on your computer. Websites that you visit use these to identify you on repeated visits. Cookies can help site owners answer questions like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are you logged in?</li>
            <li>Have you visited this site before?</li>
            <li>Which pages did you look at? If you were on the checkout page, we can infer that you were close to buying. If you got to the purchase confirmation page, you've converted.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is why we can log into different accounts on the same website by using a private / incognito session, or a different browser.</p>
        
        <p>Here's a guide on cookies that are typically used for marketing (and how this is gradually changing in the industry): <a href="https://www.disruptiveadvertising.com/ppc/cookie-based-retargeting/">Why Cookie-Based Retargeting Might Not Work in 2019</a></p>
